# Mini-project repo
In this repository, I have uploaded some projects I have done in order to further my understanding of basic security concepts and functions such as authentication, keylogging, encryption, decryption etc. and will continue to do so. 
Here is a brief about each project uploaded: 
## Keylogger
A keylogger is a software (or even a hardware device) that is used to record and log a user's keystrokes without their knowledge - in order to capture any sensitive information such as passwords, PINs and other PII.
They keylogger here has been implemented using **pynput.keyboard**, a package used to control and monitor input devices

## Graphical Password Authentication
A graphical password authenticator is a type of authentication system that uses images, patterns, or other graphical elements as a means of verifying a user's identity. Unlike the usual text based passwords, graphical passwords leverage the visual memory and recognition capabilities of users.
I have implemented a Graphical Password Authentication system using TKinter library, Python's standard GUI library. The users must click on a sequence of images (of western classical composers) in a specific order, and the grid is refreshed after each attempt.
